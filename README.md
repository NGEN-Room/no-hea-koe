# Kia ora!! 

Welcome to your first Github / Coding lesson using Github + Git ( version control )

congradulations for making it this far! By that im sure you have successfully demonstated a "CLONING" your very first "REPO".

Now in your pairs you should have cloned the 'no-hea-koe' repo ( in the NGEN-Room ORG ) down to your workspace folder. 
These are the next steps

# Pepeha
- Create a new .md file in your command line ( if its not on your cheatsheet check the whiteboard )
- Name it "your-name" pepeha
- open the file in "vs code"
- Fill out a basic pepeha (who you are),  you can use the one you did with matua Gene
- Copy over questions in the "example_technical_review"
- try your best to fill this out using your researching skills and problem solving skills ( im doing this so you can understand a little bit mpre of what you are doing rather than just doing)
- Save this file once you have completed the questions

# Staging / Pushing
time to practice your version control!
remember: Add/staging > Commit > Push

- once you have saved your progress start your staging process
- first step: STAGE your code ( this will be tricky so take your time to understand)
- Second step: COMMIT your code, write a good commit message !
- Third step: PUSH your code! ( once you have got to this level it should be getting pushed to the NGEN-Room ORG on github, CONGRADULATIONS if everything went smooth)

# Merging 
Now that you have pushed your 'code' up to the Github org get your pairing partner to "MERGE" these changes in the 'no-hea-koe' repo

to do this:
- enter the repo
